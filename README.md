DESCRIPTION OF THIS TASK

# üß† Task 2 ‚Äì Deep Learning Project (Image Classification with PyTorch)

This repository contains my **Task 2** submission for the **CodTech Internship**, where I implemented an image classification model using **PyTorch** and the **CIFAR-10** dataset.

---

## ‚úÖ Objective

To build and train a deep learning model for **image classification** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and visualize the training process and predictions.

---

## üìö Dataset

- **CIFAR-10**: A standard image dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 categories (airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
- The dataset is **automatically downloaded** and saved locally when you run the script.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch (torch, torchvision)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

---

## üöÄ Features

- Data loading and normalization using `torchvision`
- Custom CNN built using `nn.Sequential`
- Training loop with real-time accuracy tracking
- Test set evaluation
- GPU/CPU support based on device availability

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**
bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
Run the script
python task2_cnn_image_classification.py
